This repository documents and automates the rebuild of my homelab, with a focus on DevOps practices, infrastructure-as-code, and system design.

## 📌 Goals

- Document all infrastructure and network design
- Apply professional DevOps and architectural principles at home

- [Architecture Diagrams](./docs/diagrams/)
- [System Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)

## 📦 Components

- [Docker Services](./docker/)
- [Infrastructure Configs (MikroTik, Ubuntu)](./infrastructure/)

## 🚀 CI/CD

GitHub Actions are used to validate, test, and (eventually) deploy infrastructure and container updates.
